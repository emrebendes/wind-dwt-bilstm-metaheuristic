# Joint Hyperparameter Optimization of DWT–BiLSTM for Wind Speed Forecasting

Companion code and results for the manuscript:

> Bendeş, E. (2026). *Joint Hyperparameter Optimization of a DWT–BiLSTM
> Architecture for Wind Speed Forecasting: A Systematic Comparison of
> Metaheuristic Algorithms with Component Ablation Analysis.*
> Submitted to **Knowledge-Based Systems** (Elsevier).

This repository contains the complete experimental code, configuration
files, per-iteration trial histories, and analysis outputs for a
four-phase study that benchmarks **eight metaheuristic algorithms** on
the joint nine-dimensional hyperparameter optimization of a DWT–BiLSTM
hybrid wind-speed-forecasting architecture.

---

## Highlights

- Joint 9-dimensional hyperparameter optimization benchmarks **8
  metaheuristics** (ABC, GA, PSO, GWO, HO, FNO, Raindrop, TOA) under an
  identical 2,000-evaluation budget with 30 independent seeded runs each.
- **Grey Wolf Optimizer** ranks first (Friedman χ² = 49.76; p < 10⁻⁸).
- **Joint** optimization dominates the **sequential** alternative across
  all 90 paired runs (Cliff δ = 1.00; p < 10⁻⁹) with a 39% median RMSE
  gain.
- Component ablation shows the **DWT** layer is essential (Cohen's
  d = 13.09) while bidirectionality contributes negligibly at the
  one-hour horizon (p = 0.674).
- Persistence skill score = **0.4364**; GWO is Pareto-dominant in
  accuracy and run-time.

## Experimental Protocol (Four Phases)

| Phase | Question | Method | Key Output |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | Which of 8 metaheuristics finds the lowest RMSE? | 8 algos × 30 seeded runs; joint 9-D search | Friedman ranking, GWO wins |
| **Phase 2** | Is joint optimization better than sequential? | 3 algos × 30 paired runs; Shannon-entropy DWT pick then BiLSTM search | Cliff δ = 1.00; joint dominates |
| **Phase 3** | Which architectural component carries the gain? | GWO + ablations: nodwt, nobidir | DWT essential (d = 13.09), bidirectionality marginal (p = 0.674) |
| **Phase 4** | Is single-year HP search robust across years? | GWO re-run on Y2–Y6 | Cross-window variance 30–45% → ≤7% after retraining |

Each phase has its own `faz{N}_*_runs/` (raw experimental output) and
`faz{N}_*_compare/` or `faz{N}_*_results/` (aggregated analysis).

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch (CUDA optional but recommended for `final_training_v4.py`)
- Linux/macOS preferred; Windows works with WSL or native Anaconda

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/wind_optimization.git
cd wind_optimization
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate           # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Reproducing the Analyses (no GPU required)

If you only want to reproduce the **tables and figures** in the paper
from the existing experimental output, no GPU and no re-running of
optimization is required:

```bash
# Phase 1 — aggregate 8-algo benchmark + statistical tests
python compare_algorithms.py

# Phase 1 — convergence, diversity, and wall-time analyses
python analyze_convergence_diversity_timing.py

# Phase 1 — persistence baseline & skill score
python compute_persistence_baseline.py

# Phase 2 — joint vs sequential paired statistics
python sequential_with_metaheuristic.py --analyze --algos gwo,pso,ga

# Phase 3 — ablation comparison
python compare_ablations.py --algo gwo --ablations nodwt,nobidir

# Phase 4 — walk-forward consistency tests
python analyze_walk_forward.py --algo gwo --windows Y2,Y3,Y4,Y5,Y6
```

### Re-running the Optimization Itself (HPC recommended)

A full re-run of all four phases involves **~480,000 surrogate
evaluations** and was conducted on the
[TÜBİTAK ULAKBİM TRUBA cluster](https://www.truba.gov.tr/) using 36-core
nodes. On a single workstation a full re-run may take days. To run a
single Phase-1 campaign for one algorithm:

```bash
# Smoke test (one short run on each algo)
python smoke_test_optimizers.py

# Single campaign: 30 GWO runs
python manage_multiple_runs_v4.py --algo gwo --n-runs 30 \
       --pop-size 40 --max-iter 50 --workers 35
```

Per-trial histories are written to SQLite databases under
`faz1_comparison_runs/{algo}_runs/run_NNN/{algo}_running.db` so that
incomplete runs can be resumed and analysed without loss of data.

## Data Availability

> ⚠️ **Raw wind-speed time series are NOT included in this repository.**

The hourly wind speed observations used in the study were obtained from
the **Turkish State Meteorological Service (Meteoroloji Genel Müdürlüğü,
MGM)** under an institutional research-use license. The license granted
to the corresponding author covers **research use only** and **does not
permit redistribution**.

Researchers who wish to reproduce the experiments end-to-end on the
identical dataset are kindly directed to contact MGM directly through
their official data request channel
([https://mgm.gov.tr](https://mgm.gov.tr)) to obtain a comparable
license. The eight Nevşehir stations used in this study are: Acıgöl,
Avanos, Derinkuyu, Gülşehir, Hacıbektaş, Kozaklı, Nevşehir, and Ürgüp.
Time range: 51,144 hourly observations per station (≈ 5.84 years).

The repository's analysis scripts and aggregated result JSONs allow
**verification of every published number, figure, and table** without
access to the raw data.

### Expected Data Layout

If you obtain the data from MGM independently, place it under:

```
data_files/
├── all_station_data.npy              # shape (8, 51144); float32 m/s
├── ACIGÖL_data.npy                   # individual station files (optional)
├── AVANOS_data.npy
├── DERİNKUYU_data.npy
├── GÜLŞEHİR_data.npy
├── HACIBEKTAŞ_data.npy
├── KOZAKLI_data.npy
├── NEVŞEHİR_data.npy
└── ÜRGÜP_data.npy
```

The path is configured in `config.py` (`All_STATION_DATA_PATH`).

## Key Files for Verification

If you do **not** need to re-run the optimization but want to confirm the
statistics reported in the paper, the following small files contain the
canonical numerical results:

| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `faz1_comparison_runs/{algo}_final_results/analysis_summary.json` | Per-algorithm Phase 1 final summary (best loss, params, 30-run stats) |
| `faz1_comparison_results/aggregate_summary.json` | Phase 1 cross-algorithm aggregate |
| `faz1_comparison_results/persistence_results.json` | Persistence baseline + skill score (0.4364) |
| `faz2_sequential_compare/joint_vs_sequential_summary.json` | Cliff's δ, paired Wilcoxon p-values |
| `faz3_ablation_results/ablation_summary.json` | Ablation effect sizes (Cohen's d, Cliff δ) |
| `faz4_walk_forward_compare/gwo_summary.json` | Walk-forward HP consistency + Kruskal–Wallis |

Each of these is human-readable JSON and corresponds directly to a
specific table or figure in the manuscript.

## Dependencies

The core scientific stack is:

```
numpy
scipy
pandas
scikit-learn
torch                  (PyTorch; optional if only running analyses)
PyWavelets
matplotlib
```

A pinned `requirements.txt` is provided. If you only intend to run the
analysis (not the optimization), `torch` is optional.
